## Repository Evaluation Delegation

**Status:** Completed via KODA EM (Engineering Specialist)
**Task:** Evaluate face swapping/repo integration for LiveEmote improvements
**Kanban Task:** t_bc855b2e
**Completion Time:** Sun Jul 12 17:42:13 PDT 2026

### Results Summary
Koda evaluated 18+ face swapping and deepfake repositories for potential LiveEmote improvements. Key findings:

**Current State:** LiveEmote uses Deep-Live-Cam via DeepLiveCamAdapter, but the adapter is non-functional for actual face swapping.

**Primary Recommendation:** Evaluate FaceFusion as a replacement/alternative to Deep-Live-Cam due to:
- More recent active development (updated July 12, 2026)
- Industry-leading face manipulation platform
- Modular, job-based architecture
- Built-in benchmarking tools
- Includes lip-sync functionality
- Potentially more favorable licensing

**Secondary Recommendations:**
1. Create abstraction layer for hot-swapping between face swap backends
2. Implement performance tiers (preview vs. render modes)
3. Integrate benchmarking capabilities similar to FaceFusion
4. Implement fallback strategies for graceful degradation

**Next Steps:**
1. Proof-of-concept integration of FaceFusion core functionality
2. Side-by-side comparison with current Deep-Live-Cam implementation
3. License compliance verification
4. Community feedback gathering

**Related Files:** This evaluation complements the general improvement recommendations in this document, particularly those related to error handling, performance optimization, and observability.

## Implementation Status (2026-07-12)

ALL 28 improvement tasks PLUS the face-swap integration are COMPLETE and merged into `main` (HEAD `42a6c85`).

- **Improvement tasks** (config, error handling, testing, performance, code quality, observability) were implemented across branches `wt/config-1-env-vars`, `koda/obs`, `koda/perf`, `koda/test5` and consolidated into `koda/quality` (which also added a test-regression-fix commit). `koda/quality` was merged into `main`.
- **Face-swap integration** implemented in `koda/faceswap` (merged into `main`): new `packages/hermes_avatar/renderer/facefusion_adapter.py` (`FaceSwapAdapter` + `BackendManager` + frame pipeline), `DeepLiveCamAdapter` rewritten as a backward-compatible subclass of it, `FaceSwapConfig` added to `schema.py` with `FACESWAP__*` env overrides, wired into `demo_orchestrator.py` / `apps/demo_server/main.py` / `apps/demo_server/routes.py` health.
- **Verification:** full-repo `py_compile` clean; **67 unit/integration tests pass** (config, integration, observability, performance, affect-property, caching/pooling, face-swap).
- **Caveat — not runtime-tested here:** real GPU face-swap could not be executed in this environment (no GPU, no models, `cv2` absent). The `swap()` call sites are structured but degrade to passthrough in this env; they invoke the real FaceFusion / Deep-Live-Cam backend on a GPU host with models installed.
- **Not pushed to origin** (local branches only): `koda/obs`, `koda/perf`, `koda/quality`, `koda/test5`, `koda/faceswap`, `wt/config-1-env-vars`, `add-improvement-todos`.
